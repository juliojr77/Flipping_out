# DESCRIPTION

This Jupiter notebook contains an function to flip a coin and a funtion to simulate the flipping of the coin a **"n"** number of times. 
wiht a default value of 2**8. With such expoential paramenter intervals were created from 2**0, 2**1, 2**2, and so on until the default
"n" is reach (2**8) recording the results of every single interval.

Having those intervals recorded a plot funtion plot will plot a line for the difference between heads and tails at each recorded point, 
and another with the ratio of heads to tails at each recorded point.

Then another plot is made again, but as scatter plots using the difference and the ratios os every interval.


The Jupyter notebook containning this funtions can be found in this [link.](http://localhost:8889/notebooks/coin-flips.ipynb)
